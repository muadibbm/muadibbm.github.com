		<h6 style="font-size:40px">Cube</h6>
				<p style><br>A turned-based survival game for 2-8 players inspired by the movie Cube(1997).
				The board is made up of 25 squares and 1 extra square that moves around the others. These
				squares represent rooms and have pathways to each other. Some are blocked by traps or other
				obstacles. All players start the game in the center room and move using dice rolls. 
				The player wins who can enter the moving 26th room and escape the Cube. Players can 
				rotate rooms when they are in them thus creating new pathways. 
				Inorder to succeed they have to collaborate but at the end only one can survive.
				I developed this prototype in 2006 using wood and printed paper. I designed the game in such a way that
				players require a collaborator/traitor relation with each other at diffrent stages of the game.
				Everyone is trying to surrvive and that changes them which is the same theme explored in the movie.</p>

		<h6 style="font-size:40px">Conquest</h6>
				<p style><br>A turned-based strategy game for 2-4 players. I developed an early version of
				the game in 2003 and a more complete version in 2005. The game is all hand-painted which
				includes the map, the territory cards and the faction flags. At the start of the game, each player 
				chooses a faction including a special character(mage, barbarian, king, goddess) and a capital region. 
				Their goal is to conquer other players' captials.
				Each turn of the game is a season and owned terriotries can produce wood, iron and/or tax; based
				on their geographical characteristics. Players use these resources to build armies and conquer the
				world. There are only two types of armies: soldiers and knights. They can each move certain number of steps
				every turn. The battle system of the game uses number of units and dice rolls to determine the outcome of each
				fought battle.
				There are also random events like natural disasters that occur at the end of the year(4 turns).
				Strategy games were always my favorite. I wanted to make a game that was a combination of 
				Age of Empires, Backgammon, Chess, Risk with RPG elements.</p>

		<h6 style="font-size:40px">Lumberjack</h6>
				<p style><br>A turned-based RPG survival game for 2-4 players. Each player is a lumberjack who
				has a small house at each corner of the board. The game board is made up of a grid of octagons.
				The players can move for a certain steps every turn and perform an action. 
				The goal is to reach the other players' houses and burn them. To do so, all players have
				to clear a path in the forest to each other. The players cannot see behind
				the initial line of trees and all the hidden pieces are flipped on their back. The player have to cut
				down trees and explore the forest. There are various types of trees, forest creatures, herbs and treasures in the
				game. Using items found in the forest, they can upgrade their weaponry, house or armour. As the forest clears out,
				the creatures in the forest (NPC) become more aware and aggressive to the player. If the game is not over until a
				certain time, the spirit of the forest will awaken and the game changes into a co-op boss battle.
				The main theme I wanted to explore in the game was the destruction of nature by mankind. The players destroy the forest
				for resources and to win the game, by doing so the forest rises up againts them.</p>
