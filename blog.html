		<h6 style="font-size:46px">AI Movement for Absolute Beginners in Unity3D</h6>
		<div class="blogentry"><p>
			Since the time when this website went online, I had been trying to write dev-blogs or tutorials on game development but had failed countless times.
			Now finally I have decided to test my writing skills and try to share the things I have learned with anyone interested.
			I recentlly posted a question on couple of facebook groups such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/8117041572/">Indie Game Developers</a> and  
			<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/Unity3DGameDev/">Unity 3D Game Developers</a> asking what topics in game development people are mostly interested in.
			AI behaviours, pathfinding, shaders, 3rd person controller with animation, etc were some of the requested topics. There was also a wide variety between people's
			experiences ranging from beginners to advanced developers. Based on all of this, I decided to start with AI behaviours for thoes who are new to programming and then
			get into more advanced topics later on such as pathfinding algorithms.
			<br></br>
			In this entry, we are going to build a simple AI with multiple movement behaviours. We won't do any pathfinding ourselves for now and will rely on Unity's <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Navmeshes.html">Navmesh</a>.
			I am assuming you have Unity3D installed and have just started learning.
